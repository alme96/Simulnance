Reproducibility

In our model we want to simulate a financial market.
For this purpose we used a agent based approach.
The agents represent traders, which trade one single asset.
To simulate how traders place their offers we had to make assumptions on how they behave.
In the order generation process we assume that traders place their offers with respect to a normal distribution.

In this simple reproducibility test we let you simulate the market and plot the estimated price path of the stock.

1. Make sure to have all the packages needed installed. The two packages "matplotlib" and "mesa" are not preinstalled.
2. Run the file "Reproducibility_light" without changing any of the code. After say 5 seconds you should receive a plot of the price path. This
